# Dashboard

The dashboard is the main page after login. It shows an overview of the mailserver: domains, users, and quick links to common tasks.

From the dashboard you can navigate to domain, user, alias, fetchmail, and DKIM management, and to the DNS Validation Wizard and observability dashboards when available.
